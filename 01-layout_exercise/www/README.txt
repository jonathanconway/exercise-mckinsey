• You can execute my solution by opening 'testIndex.html' in your browser.

• Solution is optimised for the latest version of Chrome, as per instructions.

• Accessibility

	○ All IMG tags which convey content include ALT text, for visually-impaired
	  users.

	○ The diagram image includes an image map, which textually describes the
	  content of the diagram, for visually-impaired users.

• Things I would do if I had more time:

	○ Convert decorative images to CSS. For example, I'd use a gradient for the
	  header background, SVG for the process diagram (with a hidden textual
	  alternative to vision-impaired users) and an SVG-based graphics library
	  (such as Raphael) for the pie-charts.

	○ Make it work in multiple desktop browsers: Firefox, IE8, IE9, IE10.

	○ Add responsive styling and test on mobile devices: iOS, Android.
